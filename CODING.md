# APEX CASINO — CODING ARCHITECTURE & FRONTEND STANDARDS

## 1. Overview
APEX Dragon Tiger is an enterprise-grade, high-frequency Peer-to-Peer (P2P) live gaming and cashier exchange. The system is engineered as a Vite + React + Express full-stack single-page application (SPA) with native WebSocket real-time event broadcasting, cryptographic Provably Fair verification, and Progressive Web App (PWA) native installation.

## 3. Strict Development Rules

### 1. Zero Bots Allowed (`no bot allow`)
- Automated simulated bots are prohibited across the entire codebase.
- All table bets and P2P challenges must originate from real, authenticated user sessions.
- P2P Matchmaking in `OneOnOneArena.tsx` creates authentic rooms on `/api/rooms/create` that wait for real peers (all mock bot auto-acceptors removed).
- Frequency-based anti-bot detection rate-limits rapid room creation and protects matchmaking integrity.

### 2. Zero Bonuses Allowed (`no bonus allow`)
- Artificial promotional bonus balances, fake signup bonuses, and lock-in deposit bonuses are strictly prohibited.
- User balances represent 100% real capital or isolated demo credits.
- All cosmetics (card backs, player frames, badges) are unlocked through actual gameplay achievements without bonus purchase friction.

### 3. Global Build Number Visibility (`show build number everywhere footer`)
- The active `BUILD_NUMBER` imported from `src/config/version.ts` must be rendered in every footer surface:
  1. `LoginScreen.tsx`: Login page bottom status bar.
  2. `RegulatoryFooter.tsx`: Universal footer rendered across all views.
  3. `MobileBottomNav.tsx`: Micro build indicator anchored above mobile tabs.
  4. `GameTable.tsx`: Integrated in table HUD telemetry console.
  5. `OneOnOneArena.tsx`: Status footer in 1v1 arena.
  6. `P2PLobby.tsx`: Global multiplayer lobby footer.
  7. `Leaderboard.tsx`: Elite rankings footer.
  8. `SideNavDrawer.tsx`: Dedicated system version block.
  9. `AdminLogin.tsx` & `AdminDashboard.tsx`: Administrative console build stamps.

### 4. PWA Installation & Launch Mechanics
- **Why "Open" previously failed**: Standard web browsers forbid web pages from programmatically launching installed external apps via `window.location.href`. Navigating to `/` merely reloads the browser tab.
- **The Modern Approach**:
  - `usePWAInstall.ts`: Detects true standalone execution (`isStandalone`) via `(display-mode: standalone)`.
  - Inside standalone mode, the app is already open, so install prompts are hidden.
  - In browser mode, clicking "Install App" triggers `deferredPrompt.prompt()` if available.
  - If `deferredPrompt` is not yet available, or on iOS Safari, or if user requests guidance, `PWAInstallModal.tsx` opens:
    - Provides device-specific instructions for Android (Chrome 3 dots ➔ Install app), iOS (Share ➔ Add to Home Screen), and Desktop.
    - Explicitly explains how to open the app from phone's Home Screen / App Drawer.
    - Provides a "Copy App Link" button for in-app webviews (WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram).

## 4. Frontend Component Guidelines
- **Responsive Viewport (`100dvh`)**: Mobile containers must use dynamic viewport height `h-[100dvh]` to avoid mobile address bar overlap.
- **Zero Inline Styles**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively.
- **Audio Feedback**: All user actions (button clicks, chips, deals, wins, losses, coin deposits) are bound to `sound.*` utilities.
- **Typography & Aesthetics**: High-contrast gold (`amber-400`), emerald (`emerald-400`), and crimson accents on dark luxury obsidian backgrounds.
